You need to design an appropriate webpage layout for Dreamy Cafe. HTML5 structural elements must be used. You are free to use other structural elements.

### Task 2: Website Development

#### 2.1 HTML 3 Webpages

The three webpages must be developed using HTML5. All pages must ***not contain any deprecated elements/attributes***. The content requirements for each webpage are as follows:

+ Page *index.html* is the homepage of the website. It should provide introductory information about Dreamy Cafe, its history, menu, location, available types of coffees, etc. Feel free to refer to real-world coffee shops websites for example. Information about at least three types of coffees must be provided, with at least three original or explicitly referenced images.

+ Page registration.html is for users to register. A form must be provided, which contains different input elements that allow users to enter registration information, e.g., username, password, gender, email, favourite coffee, etc. The following input elements must be used:

  * label
  * textbox
  * password
  * radiobutton
  * checkbox
  * selectlist
  * submitbutton

#### 2.2: CSS Files

At least one CSS file is to be created to style all three HTML pages. Use any CSS properties you deem necessary and appropriate for the presentation. You are encouraged to be creative in your design. You will mark not only on the use of CSS properties and selectors but also on how professional, beautiful and creative your webpages look.

#### 2.3: JavaScript File

A JavaScript file must be created for the registration and the order pages to validate the input data before forms are submitted to the server for processing. The JavaScript must

* check that none of the required input fields are blank.
* check that the password is at least 7-character long;
* check that the postcode is 4-digit.
* show an alert or inline error messages to display all the errors in the input fields;
* allow the form to be submitted only if all the input data are valid.

### Task 3: Website Enhancement

#### 3.1 Features

Implement the following 3 features using appropriate HTML, CSS and JavaScript:

 + Highlight the menu item in the navigator corresponding to the current webpage.
 + In page order.html, create a checkbox with label “same as delivery address” somewhere appropriate near the fields for billing address. When this checkbox is \ checked, the fields for billing address will be filled with the delivery address automatically. If the delivery address is not completed when this checkbox is checked, display an alert or inline message: “Please enter your delivery address first”.
 + Allow users to choose from three types of credit card: Visa, MasterCard and American Express. Based on the type of credit card, limit the length of the credit card number, 16 digits for Visa and MasterCard, 15 digits for American Express.
   
#### 3.2 Features Page
